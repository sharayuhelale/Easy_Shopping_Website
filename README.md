# Easy_Shopping_Website
Project Description:
Easy Shopping is a static website developed as a college project to understand how websites work. The main purpose of this project is to learn the basic structure, design, and functionality of a website. The project is small and simple, focusing on clarity and ease of use.
This website is created using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. HTML is used to structure the content, CSS is used for styling and layout, and JavaScript is used to add simple interactive features.
The file CSS.html is the main file of the project, and all other HTML files are subfiles linked to it. The project also includes image files, which are used to enhance the visual appearance of the website.
This project helped me understand how web pages are created, styled, and connected, and gave me hands-on experience with front-end web development.
